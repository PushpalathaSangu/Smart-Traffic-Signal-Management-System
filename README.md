# Smart-Traffic-Signal-Management-System
## INTRODUCTION
This project develops an AI-based dynamic traffic signal system using object detection to optimize traffic flow. It analyzes real-time traffic data and adjusts signal timings based on vehicle density. It also describes the accompanying Streamlit-based web application that demonstrates how to use the trained model for lane-wise vehicle detection and green-time calculation.

## WEB APPLICATION OVERVIEW
We developed a Streamlit-based web application to demonstrate real-time lane-wise vehicle counting and dynamic green-time calculation using the trained model.

### Key Features
- **Multiple Lane Input:** Users can specify how many lanes they want to analyze.
- **Automatic Detection:** The YOLOv9 model (`best.pt`) is loaded onto the Streamlit server.
- **Image & Video Support:** Each lane can have an uploaded image or video file.
- **Vehicle Counting:** Counts the number of recognized vehicles by type.
- **Dynamic Signal Timing:** Calculates a proportional green-time for each lane based on total vehicle count.

### Workflow Summary
1. The user enters the number of lanes.
2. For each lane, the user uploads an image or video.
3. The application runs inference with the YOLOv9 model.
4. Detections are drawn, and total vehicle counts are aggregated.
5. A dynamic green-time (in seconds) is computed for each lane.
6. Results are displayed with detection outputs and recommended signal times.

## TRAINING PROCESS

- Link of the YOLOv9 training notebook: https://github.com/suma-vatturi/ai-powered-smart-traffic-management-system/blob/main/training_notebook.ipynb

### Data Preparation & Annotation
- Employed an open-source labeling tool (or Roboflow annotation interface).
- Maintained uniform class naming conventions (e.g., car, bus, truck, etc.).
- Ensured accurate bounding boxes for robust vehicle detection.

### Data Augmentation
- **Techniques:** Random flipping, rotation, scaling, hue/saturation adjustments.
- **Purpose:** Increases training sample diversity and reduces overfitting.

### Fine-Tuning
- Adjusted learning rate, batch size, and IoU thresholds to optimize mAP.
- Focused on balancing precision and recall.

### Model Evaluation & Key Metrics
- **Validation & Testing:**
  - mAP(0.5), mAP(0.5:0.95), precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - YOLOv9’s speed (FPS) ensures near real-time detection.

## FUTURE SCOPE
- **Priority-Based Traffic Control:** Automatically detect and prioritize ambulances, police vehicles, etc.
- **Load Balancing:** Differentiate large vehicles (trucks/buses) vs. smaller vehicles to reduce congestion.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Use historical data and forecasting models to preemptively adjust signals.
